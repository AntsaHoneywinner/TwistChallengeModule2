# TwistChallengeModule2

This repository contains the code I am working on for the Twist Challenge Module 2 on DSI program.

In this project, I will use the TIMMS 2019 data to predict mathematics achievement for students in grade 4 in Philippines, South Africa, Turkey and United States.

The data is in a database and will be hoooked into a dashboard.
